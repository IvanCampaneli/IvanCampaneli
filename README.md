__Hello World!__

As a technology enthusiast, I have explored various fields before finding my calling in programming. I have a degree in Gastronomy, and my previous experience involved working as a Chef. In my most recent role, I gained valuable experience in stock management, finance, team training, and other aspects of running a successful restaurant.

I recognize the significance of these experiences and how they have prepared me for my journey as a programmer. I believe that my diverse background has provided me with a unique perspective and problem-solving skills that I can bring to any project. I am eager to continue learning and growing in this field, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
